# Pie Math

`packages/pie-math` includes all calculations for drawing diagrams (business logic).\
It is used by `packages/simple-pie` and `packages/react-simple-pie`.

Read more [here](../../README.md)

### Note for myself
I created two `pathFactories` instead of one. To keep simplicity of pie diagram.
However, obvious `doughnutPathFactory` can be used to build pie with 0 inner radius
