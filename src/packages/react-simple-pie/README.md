  <p>Super light weight and super simple svg pie/doughnut diagram</p>
</div>

This project creates simple svg pie and doughnut charts for infographics like graphs and others.

**Note:** If you are going to use simple diagram in not react project, please check [Simple Pie](https://github.com/serjilyashenko/react-simple-pie/tree/master/src/packages/simple-pie) out.
`simple-pie` and `react-simple-pie` packages are parts of the [Simple Pie Project](https://github.com/serjilyashenko/simple-pie-project) repo

Check out the demo [here](https://simple-pie.netlify.app/)

## Motivation

Some time ago I had to integrate a network graph. And the every node of the network graph would be tiny pie chart.
The network graph library doesn't support anything else except png or svg as node inner content.
So, it is not very nice idea to keep a bunch of png or svg files for every case of data distribution.
And for obvious reasons it is not possible to use HighCharts, Chart.js or other data visualization library.
(Perhaps it would work with d3, but I'm not sure, it is an overkill to keep such big library for the such small purpose)

Well the `simple-pie` does exactly this thing. It generates tiny svg pie which can be integrated into network graph or
map or any other case, when you can't use data-visualization libraries.


## Installation

```shell
npm install react-simple-pie --save

# or

yarn add react-simple-pie
```

### Use

```js
import React from 'react';
import {SimplePie, SimpleDoughnut} from "react-simple-pie"

export default function YourComponent() {
  return (
    <section>
      <div style={{width: 200, height: 200}}>
        <SimpleDoughnut values={[1, 2, 1, 2]} />
      </div>*/}
      <div style={{width: 200, height: 200}}>
        <SimpleDoughnut values={[1, 1, 1]} borderWidth={4} borderColor="green" />
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
```

Since `simplePie` and `simpleDoughnut` return regular svg, you can use it as you wish.

**Note:** svg `height` and `width` are `100%`, so it trys to extend itself to available space. Thus, you should have wrapper with dimensions for your simple-pie diagram.

## Interface

```ts
export type TPieProps = {
  values: number[];
  palette?: string[];
  borderColor?: string;
  borderWidth?: number;
};

export type TDoughnutProps = TPieProps & {
  innerRadius?: number; // 0..1 - percent from outer radius
};
```
