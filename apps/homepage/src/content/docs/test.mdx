title: Single Sector Visual Test

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import SingleSectorTest from '@components/SingleSectorTest.astro'

<Aside type="tip">
  The deal is if there is only one value in the data array, simple-pie draws circle or doughnut instead of sectors.
  Before this solution it was buggy for some single values.
  May be in future I'll write snapshot test for this. But now this section is to check if everything is fine
