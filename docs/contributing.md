# Contributing

There is a few conventions around code.

## Commit format

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is commit message convention.

Probably, [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) will be added to enforce the convention. 🧐

Some common ones are:
- `build`
- `chore`
- `ci`
- `docs`
- `feat`
- `fix`
- `perf`
- `refactor`
- `revert`
- `style`
- `test`

## Linting

🚧TBD
